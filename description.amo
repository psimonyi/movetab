Dragging tabs around can be a drag.  Move tabs with the context menu instead.

<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
<li>Move to the left/right end of the tab strip
<li>Move to an existing window or create a new one
<li>Mark a destination tab, then move tabs beside it
</ul>

<b>Permissions and privacy:</b>
<i>Access browser tabs</i> is required for obvious reasons.
<i>Access recently closed tabs</i> lets tabs you mark as teleport targets remain marked after undo-close-tab and after restarting Firefox if you have enabled the preference "When Firefox starts: Show your windows and tabs from last time".
<i>Access your data for all websites</i> is a technical workaround for limitations in the WebExtensions API.  There is no way to visually mark individual tabs, so this extension marks tabs by updating the page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> in order to change the tab title.  No other changes are made to websites, and it does not read information from any websites.

Note: The workaround for marking tabs described above means that certain tabs will not appear to be marked.  This includes special Firefox pages such as Preferences and the Add-ons Manager, and certain sensitive Mozilla domains such as addons.mozilla.org.
